# The Magic of Technology

How far has technology come, it brings me a sense of awe and appreciation that we live in a time with such amazing technology that just 50 years ago might have seem like pure magic and witchcraft.

Do you remember how much a 400GB hard drive cost 10 years ago? Me neither because I probably can't afford it back then.  Today you can get a 400GB SD card at about $100.  That's a card the size of your nails.  That's insane!

It might seem trivial but the technology in this video is using technology of computer vision + pose estimation + deep learning that has long been in a sort of hibernation mode because of not having enough data to train on and also expensive hardware.  

The fact that we have this technology today is because of smart people in labs and universities around the world pushing the frontiers of science.

Thank you all scientists and PhDs!! <3
