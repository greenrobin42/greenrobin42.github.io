# Alone in the crowd

Since the start of quarantine due to the pandemic, I've been mostly staying indoors at home other than the occasional times where I go out to buy groceries.

I always thought of myself to be more on the introverted side of things hence I thought quarantine would not be such a hard time for me.

For the most I enjoy being myself but there's one thing that I sort of miss is that feeling of being among crowds.

Before the pandemic, I would purposely do things that let me float among crowds of people, either by being a background scenery or a silent observer.  I love walking among the crowded streets of the city, silently drinking coffee in a fully packed coffee shop or simply witnessing the sunset with flocks of tourists at the pier.

So I wonder really, I don't like interacting with strangers but somehow I love the feeling of being in a crowd.  So this piece here is about the reasons on why I love being alone in a crowd--never interacting, just observing.

I love looking at people's facial expressions, their body language and especially how they interact with the people they are with.  Is that their sister? Or is that their significant other?  Can I tell just by their hand gestures or how their eyes stare into each other?  Is that teary eye because of a touching YouTube or a memory flashback of a painful breakup?  Is that frown after getting coffee because they regretted spending $5 on a coffee or are they stressed out about a job interview tomorrow?

That's when I realized: I love being in a crowd because it allows me to feel so small and insignificant.  Here I am, blessed, being able-bodied, witnessing the sunset, breathing that semi-fresh air with little worries observing others.  I look at these lives around me and wonder the lives they are living, the challenges they are facing and I know that my troubles are never as big as most people around the world.

I love walking in the city with huge skyscrappers that can cast shadows as large as a football field.  I love the feeling of being small amidst the creations of mankind, knowing that one day all these will perish too.  I love seeing charming old buildings in downtown knowing that there exists a history behind them long before I ever existed and will continue to go on in their legacy long after I'm gone.

I love taking the train around the city, to be among the actual heart and soul of the city--it's workers: the cashiers, the engineers, the waiters, the teachers, the contruction workers,the financial analysts, the moms, the startup founders, the undocumented hard workers, the taco sellers and everyone in between.  Sometimes I view public transportation as the great equalizer, where you can see all kinds of people on board and that everyone is here submitting themselves at the hands of the driver.  

I have many thoughts and this is one of them.  Sometimes it's hard to exactly describe everything that goes through my mind but tonight this is one of them.
