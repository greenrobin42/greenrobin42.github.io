"Pa, don't you need to be in Singapore in 3 hours?"

"Aiya relax la~!  The high speed maglev train only takes 40mins."

"Oh ya horr...haha"

"So how? Made your decision or not?  Want to study overseas or in Malaysia?"

"Hmm tough choice leh since University Malaya is one of the best universities in the world and it's tuition free!"

"Never mind girl.  If you want to go UK also can.  Don't worry about finance too much ok.  The ringgit to british pound rate is very good now"

"Ok pa I'll think about it.  Oh ya my friend from Australia is visiting, we are going out later but will be back home late, can?"

"Aiya you big girl now of course can lah~ plus it's very safe in KL city.  If you got lost or need help just ask the policemen.  They are very efficient."

"Ya la ya la haha...plus I can just take the MRT!  It's so convenient, it comes every minute."

"Ya your friend from Australia right, you should bring her to visit the national parks and beaches in Malaysia."

"Ya we are going Pangkor, but it's always filled with so many tourist!"

"Haha ya lo, the beaches and national parks are very well kept by the government. Of course a lot of tourist like to come ma~"

"Ya it's all so beautiful!  No wonder my friend from Australia always like to come here, she also say after graduation she wanna apply for a job here."

"That's nice, then u two can hang out more in the future lo"

"Ya...see how la.  Eh I'm so glad I live in Malaysia pa...everything just feels like home here.  Was it always like that ah?"

"Haha girl, a lot of things have changed actually."

"Lai let me tell you a story. So 30 years ago on the 10th of May 2018...."
