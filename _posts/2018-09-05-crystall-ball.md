Well after reading a bunch of books 📚 about the future, history, neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence 🤖 , behavioral biology 🐰, urban planning and interface designing, I am finally ready to do some crystal-balling ⚽ about industries of the short term future. 

These are based on my own opinions and observations from reading. 

So according to statisitcs, the world's GDP per capita is increasing logarithimically 💵 💵 💵 .  As such I am going to make this totally unscientific conclution that:

Earning more -> more money to trade for time ⌚ -> living longer -> more things to think/worry about 😕 -> need more meaningful things to do 😂 

So here are the rising industries according to my prediction.  I give the timeline of these industries(some has already started) becoming larger and larger from NOW till the next 10-30 years. 

It will start from the wealthier countries and slowly move towards lower income countries. 🇺🇸 🇲🇾 

I also make the assumption that normal humans will either spend their money and time on one of these:

1) Themselves 
2) Their immediate family (parents & children)

Hence, these are the industries that I predict will be growing in the near future and it all ties back to having more money, more time and wanting a more meaningful life.
