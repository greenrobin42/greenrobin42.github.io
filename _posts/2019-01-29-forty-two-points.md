# 42 - The meaning of life? 

Dropping 42 points to my younger, present and future self:

1. Be open minded to talk to new people and receive new ideas.
2. Do things deliberately and with awareness.
3. Preserve your mental resilience.
4. Never sideline your family, friends and significant other.
5. Friendships are not going to last without maintenance.  Schedule and follow through with those meetups.
6. Don't lose touch with old friends.
7. Have conversations with friends till sunrise.
8. Write and read long form content.  Stay away from short distracting social media content.
9. Stop underestimating what you can output long term and stop overestimating what you can output short term.
10. Don't treat life as a dress rehearsal, for all you know this is the main act so don't put off things u always wanted to do.
11. Always question what you are working hard on.  Working 
hard in the wrong direction gets you nowhere.
12. Work hard and smart but don't let life pass you by.
13. Do not hesitate to spend money on people you care about.
14. When there is an opportunity to invest in yourself, always do it.
15. Take risks when opportunities come.  Not taking any risks is a risk itself--a risk of losing potential outcomes.
16. Surround yourself with smart, ambitious and self-aware people.
17. Enjoy the sunshine.
18. Worry less.  A lot of things seems difficult now but when you look back, it was just a breeze.
19. Do new things once in a while.  New things can spark joy.
20. Love just as intensely your current/future partner just as you loved your first boyfriend/girlfriend.
21. Never lose that childlike excitement when it's Christmas eve right before you open your presents.  Be that excited for your job and what you do.
22. Pick the battles you can win.  
23. Self-preservation enables you to do more good in the long term.
24. You can choose to not forget but try to forgive.
25. Existential crisis come and go.  It is normal and don't fret about it.
26. Try not to binge anything.  Moderation is a key to happiness and well-being.
27. Do not be afraid to ask for what you want or need.
28. Be conscious of what you eat.
29. Use your youth well; go out and move.
30. Sacrificing sleep will almost always have negative returns.
31. Multitasking is overrated.
32. Tell the people you love that you love them.  Make a surprise visit time to time.
33. Be curious and learn throughout your life.
34. Be humble.
35. Wear sunscreen.
36. A lot of your choices are half chance so don’t mull over bad life choices.
37. Don’t judge too quickly--everyone have lives as full as yours.
38. Be empathetic.
39. Good times and bad times come and go.  This too shall pass.
40. Your parents are just normal people too who make mistakes.
41. A lot of times no one really knows what is going on.  Try not to have imposter syndrome.
42. If you think you might have an ounce of regret not doing something then just do it. Regret is the worse kind of pain.
