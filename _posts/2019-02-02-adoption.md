# Thoughts on adoption ðŸ‘ª 

So I just watched the movie "instant family" and it was about adoption. Tear jerking movie. I sometimes wonder why biology evolved humans to have so much emotions. If biology's main goal is to pass down our genes, shouldn't it be just a formula to maximize actions that reward our ability to procreate.  

Really it can be formulated into a mathematical model where you don't really need emotions to maximize the goal. However, biology did in fact have humans emotions. If we go along biology's main goal then surely emotions are introduced into humans to aid procreation. 

Yet we see cases where emotions defy that goal. Adoption is one of them. Maybe biology knew better, biology knew that emotions will bridge the gap that logic cannot explain. For to adopt is to build emotional connections without fulfilling biology's goal of passing down genes.

Humans ability to defy their biology is one of the most beautiful things that I would claim to have the privilege to witness in my life.

Perhaps defying itself was biology's preprogrammed notion after all. Maybe we're all made to act on emotions once in a while. 

After all, I don't think biology made a mistake. If that is so then so be it, let me have my feels.
